  Title: Using a RouteInitialization Service
  Description: >
    A common scenario I've encountered is the need to share common route initialization
    across several different controllers. The technique I've settled on for handling this is
    encapsulating the functionality within a RouteInitialization service that returns a promise.
    Angular waits for the promise to resolve before changing the route allowing for one or more asynchronous
    calls to return data. The service can also be made to cache objects that carry over from route
    to route avoiding uncessary network round trips. I'll demonstrate the pattern with a sample app and
    hopefully it's something you find useful for you own apps.
